# JIRA Links Shortener Plugin

It's a very simple plugin which captures pasted text and if it detects it's a link to a JIRA ticket it sets the JIRA issue number as the title. 

## Example
**Text pasted:** https://mycompany.atlassian.net/browse/PRJ-1234
**Modified result:** [PRJ-1234](https://mycompany.atlassian.net/browse/PRJ-1234)
